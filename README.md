## PRD Integration for Software Development

When using prompts for software development with AI agents, incorporating PRD (Product Requirement Document) elements enhances the clarity and completeness of the output. Here's how to structure such prompts:

### PRD-Enhanced Prompt Structure

```markdown
Project Overview:
- Project name: [Name]
- Objective: [Clear statement of purpose]
- Target users: [User personas]
- System context: [Environment, integrations]

Functional Requirements:
- Core features: [List key functionalities]
- User flows: [Step-by-step interactions]
- Business rules: [Logic and constraints]
- Data requirements: [Input/output specifications]

Technical Specifications:
- Stack requirements: [Technologies, frameworks]
- Architecture: [System design patterns]
- Dependencies: [External services, APIs]
- Performance criteria: [Metrics, SLAs]

Implementation Guidelines:
- Coding standards: [Style guides, patterns]
- Security requirements: [Authentication, authorization]
- Testing requirements: [Unit, integration, E2E]
- Documentation needs: [API docs, user guides]
```

### Example: Web Application Feature

```markdown
Role: Senior Full Stack Developer
Project Context:
- Feature: User Authentication System
- Platform: Web Application
- Stack: Node.js, React, PostgreSQL

Requirements:
1. User Management:
   - Registration with email verification
   - Password reset functionality
   - OAuth integration (Google, GitHub)

2. Security Specifications:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Rate limiting implementation

3. Technical Constraints:
   - Response time < 200ms
   - 99.9% uptime
   - GDPR compliance

Deliverables:
- API endpoints documentation
- Database schema

- Feature: In-App Messaging
- Platform: Cross-platform mobile app
- Stack: React Native, Firebase

Requirements:
1. Messaging Features:
   - Real-time chat
   - Media sharing
   - Read receipts

2. Technical Requirements:
   - Offline functionality
   - Push notifications
   - Message encryption

3. Performance Metrics:
   - Message delivery < 1s
   - Media upload < 3s
   - Storage optimization

Implementation Priority:
- Core messaging (P0)
- Media features (P1)
- Advanced features (P2)
```

## Tips for PRD-Enhanced Prompts

1. **Hierarchical Structure**
   - Start with high-level overview
   - Break down into specific components
   - Include acceptance criteria

2. **Technical Clarity**
   - Specify exact versions/technologies
   - Define interfaces and contracts
   - Include performance requirements

3. **Implementation Context**
   - Development environment details
   - Existing codebase constraints
   - Integration requirements

4. **Quality Parameters**
   - Testing requirements
   - Documentation needs
   - Performance metrics
   - Security standards

Remember: The combination of PRD elements with prompts creates a comprehensive development blueprint that helps AI agents generate more accurate and production-ready code.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Clear, detailed instructions yield better results
2. **Layer Information**: Structure from general to specific
3. **Use Examples**: Demonstrate desired output when possible
4. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on results
5. **Consider Context**: Account for audience and purpose

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Vague or ambiguous instructions
- Contradictory requirements
- Too many constraints
- Lack of context
- Unclear success criteria

## Tips for Optimization

1. Start broad, then refine
2. Test different variations
3. Learn from successful outputs
4. Document effective patterns
5. Maintain consistency in similar prompts

Remember: Effective prompt engineering is an iterative process that improves with practice and experimentation.
